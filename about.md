This is a simple Jekyll site deployed on Render. It's much simpler than Ghost and doesn't require a database.

## Why Jekyll?

- **Simple**: No databases, just Markdown files
- **Fast**: Static sites load quickly
- **Secure**: No backend vulnerabilities
- **Free**: Hosting on Render is free for static sites
- **Version Control**: All content is in Git
