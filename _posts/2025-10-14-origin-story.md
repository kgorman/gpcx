## The Origin Story

I was sitting on the patio at **Telluride Brewing**, beer in hand, happy as a man can be after a huge ride. My son was still up on the mountain, ripping the park. My wife and daughter were out shopping with the dogs. Everything was perfect — except I knew, deep down, something had to change.

I'm 54 now. I've been riding bikes since my twenties. I've never really taken a break, but I've also never been the guy at the front of the pack. Consistent, yes. Fast, no. I didn't race for the trophies; I rode for my soul. I was never the skinniest guy, but I was always out there. I grew up on Colorado's Front Range — riding **Matthew Winters Park**, the odd weekend in **Moab**, long days pedaling from downtown Denver to the foothills and back. I even raced the **Cactus Cup** once or twice. Nothing spectacular in the results, but mountain biking was my life.

In the '90s, I moved to the **Bay Area** and kept the streak alive — **Marin**, **Angel Camp**, **Mount Diablo**, endless weekends in **Downieville**, and **Skeggs Point** on the peninsula. We rode everywhere. My buddy **Abani (Abi)** was always up for a ride. Sometimes **John** would join, or my brother, or **Michael Levine**. We weren't chasing podiums; we were just chasing daylight.

Then life did what it does. Kids, companies, responsibilities — all good things, but they eat at the edges of your time. I didn't love riding any less; I just did it less.  
When we moved to **Austin** in 2013, I made a deliberate choice to live near **Emma Long Park** so I could ride from the house. But the cadence never stuck. Some months I rode ten times, some months none. A few years like that and it showed — the weight crept up, the legs got slower, and the young guns started dropping me.

Which brings me back to **Telluride**.  
Every year we go to Colorado — Yeti Tribe rides, park days, the usual mountain rituals. But this time was different. I was there, surrounded by everything I love about bikes, and I wasn't in shape to enjoy it. It ate at me. I knew I could be better. I knew I *was* better. That afternoon, staring at the mountains with a beer in hand, I decided it was time for a change.

Fast forward three months: I've been riding three times a week and I've dropped twenty-five pounds. I've signed up for two races — one done, one coming. The first was **Doss Gravel**, and I finished it. The second is the **Austin Rattler**. I don't even know if I'll finish the Rattler, but that's the point. Keep riding. Keep pushing. Make the change. Turn the corner. Put in the effort. Finish the race.

I don't know exactly where this goes from here. I just know I'll keep writing — and I'll keep *riding* more. I'm waking up in the dark, rolling out with my buddies before the sun, and yeah, they're still faster. But it doesn't matter. This is where I need to be.  
This is my spot.
