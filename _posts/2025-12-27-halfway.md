Rich Roll, an Ultra Marathoner is credited by saying "Consistency beats intensity. Consistency beats volume. Consistency beats passion. Consistency dictates results. Consistency is what defines character." The last six months has taught me that he's right on. Let me explain.

See the part I haven't written publicly was my goal. I told you all that I needed to make a change, had lost weight, but I didn't say the goal out loud. Not like in a goal sense. Sure, of course, I knew it, my wife knew it, a few others, but I didn't set the goal out loud to the world. You know, commit to it. The reason I didn't was mostly self confidence - I wasn't sure I could actually do it.

Yet, as of this morning, I weigh 241.2lbs, exactly 30lbs down since that July day in Telluride where my life changed forever. It's not just the weight loss, I am fitter than I have been since my 20's. To give you a feeling - that was 61 rides, almost 1000 miles and 100 hours of ride time.

Consistency. Plain and simple. My wattage isn't the greatest, my endurance not legendary, and my race results are shit. But - here I sit, having hit my goal - literally exactly. Part of that day in Telluride was what if? What if I just rode every day? What would my life be like?

Rich Roll nailed it again - consistency dictated results, and defined character. Eerie.

And the journey to get here has been absolutely fucking insane. Not only did I get a result, I also got to enjoy the trip. That very consistency Rich Roll talks about was my travels, not just the destination. I'll never forget Boots handing me salt tabs as he towed me home at Dos Gravel, or Brett's face at Rattler when we both had finished, or just grinding it out with JB mile after mile after mile so tired so very tired. These trails became best friends, every corner, every rock. The deer near the lake, finally doing the really hard ups and crushing the fast downs. Hello mr deer, hello rock ledge, hello leg pain. Consistency. My crew always there being supportive, and always doling out the suffering. Thank you guys.

So I am done right? I hit my goal, it's over, good job, move on. Right?

Hell no. 

This is just halfway. 

The last six months, the six months of consistency, just makes me want more. This time I am going to say the goals out loud, yell them from the rooftops, and take you all along for the ride (if you want - I know I can't force you, calm down). 

Goals (yes plural):
1. Lose another 11 lbs, putting me in the 220's. Any 200's number works, aka 229.998.
2. Be on the box - podium in any bike race. Doesn't matter what, just on the box.

By Telluride 2026, by July.

And how am I going to do this? Take my still overweight ass and get on the box, get to a weight the last time I saw was my 20's. This sounds hard, no it's starting to sound impossible. How?

Consistency.

You heard me say it. Inked. LDTS.
