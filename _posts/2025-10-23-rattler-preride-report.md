I got roped into enterring to race the Austin Rattler in a few weeks, and yeah — I knew I needed to get fitter. A lot fitter. But I didn't quite realize *how much* until now. How do I make this not sound like a death march?  

Ok, fuck it — it **was** a death march. Just not in the way I expected.

I created the SB150 BR specifically for this. Both the bike and me needed a shakedown. I hadn't been to Reveille Peak in a few years, and driving in, it looked mostly the same — endless rock, dust, and oozing Texas. We decided to get a jump on the weekend and ride Friday afternoon.  
Note: **it was hot as fook.**

I'm riding with Boots and Brett — both way fitter than me. If they weren't feeling merciful, I'd get absolutely cooked.  
Still, the bike was spotless, rebuilt, dialed. I hadn't ridden these trails in years, and I remembered them being hard and fun. Turns out, memory lies.

We rolled out right at 2 p.m., when the shooting range goes cold. You could still hear rifles echoing downrange, bullets smacking targets a mile away. I made a note: *come back here to shoot sometime*. If you're not from Texas, that last line probably made you raise an eyebrow.  
Meh. It's Texas — equal parts crazy and awesome. There's a mountain bike mecca out here — a ranch with a lake, camping, a bike shop, moto trails, and a firing range. Basically a playground for grown-up kids.  
But all that charm starts to fade around mile five.

RPR is hard to describe. The trails are a mashup of sweet singletrack, hardpack, gravel, moon rock, and punchy, loose climbs. Think **Moab meets South Mountain**, baked in 100-degree heat. My heart rate was redlined — deep in Z3 — gasping for air, arms burning on the climbs. Full-body effort, like the kind where even your forearms ache after.  

Boots and Brett were patient. Different goals. They were reconning for race lines; I was proving I could survive. I even eyed the bailout road for a second — nope, not today. They waited for me. We crawled along but kept moving.

The bike? **Butter.**  
All the work to get the suspension balanced and pedaling right paid off. I was comfy — in that "everything hurts but it's fine" kind of way. The Rekon/Rekon Race tire combo? Not fine. This place eats lightweight XC rubber alive. Need more beef, no question.

I glance at my Wahoo — 7 miles in, 1,000 calories burned. This is gonna *hurt*.  
I suck down a GU and start managing water and fuel like it's a survival mission.

Reveille is huge. Beautiful. Brutal. It's Texas' sneaky version of altitude. The climbs just never end. By day's end, I'd gain over 2,000 feet. *Texas is flat*, they said. Ha.

We fix Boots' slow leak, get a bit lost, then lose him completely to a flat. The last 5 miles are a blur — Brett glancing back every so often like, *"he's not dead yet… close though."* The guy never left me. Legend.

When we finally roll into the lot, Boots is already there — he'd short-cutted, run the last bit with his bike, showered, and cracked a beer. The man's a machine. We slam a couple cold ones as the sun drops.  
My god. What an effort.  
And we're gonna *race* this?

We'd only done one lap. In the race, Boots is doing the 60 — **three laps**. I bet he beats my time for one. One thing was clear: I need to train my ass off for the next three weeks. Finishing at race pace feels impossible. But… I just did finish, didn't I?

As the guys pack up and drive off, I sit there in the dark with my last half beer, staring out over the granite and mesquite. Exhausted, bummed I'm not in better shape, but proud I didn't quit. Proud I didn't take that fire road back.

Days later I decide — screw it. I'm racing.  
I'll finish or die trying. If I cross that line wrecked, cracked, and smiling with a cold beer in hand — that's my podium.
