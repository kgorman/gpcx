# Welcome

This is my first Jekyll blog post. Jekyll is a static site generator that makes it easy to create simple, blog-aware websites.

## Features

- Markdown support
- No database required
- Built-in support for GitHub Pages
- Extensible with plugins

```ruby
def hello_world
  puts "Hello, Jekyll!"
end
```

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll.
