excerpt: "Turning a six-year-old park bike into a Rattler weapon — coil to Float X, 38 to 36, some geometry math, and a few garage tricks that actually worked."

It actually started over beers after the Dos Gravel race. The guys said, “You should try the Austin Rattler.”

If you haven’t been to **Reveille Peak Ranch**, imagine granite domes, rolling ledges, and loose dust that somehow steals watts right out of your legs. The climbs are relentless, the descents rough and fast — pure Hill Country punishment. Three laps gets you a Leadville 100 slot, but that’s fantasy for me. One loop might be doable. Rattler? Maybe.

The problem was simple: I didn’t really have a bike for it.

### The Bike I Already Had

What I *did* have was my trusty **Yeti SB150**, a 2019 frame that’s been everywhere — Telluride, Purgatory, Snowmass. It’s mostly been my park bike. Lately I’ve been on the e-MTB more, and the 150 just hung there on the rack, half retired.

I even thought about selling it.  
Then I realized: this frame could be the foundation of a Rattler race rig. If I could make it feel somewhere between an **SB140** and an **SB120**, maybe I’d have something. Lighter, steeper, snappier — still tough enough to rip the chunks.

That’s where the *Breakfast Ride* name came from.  
Yeti has its *Lunch Ride* builds — they *over-fork* their bikes for more travel.  
This is the opposite. I *under-forked* mine.

### Step One — Shock and Fork

First thing to go was the coil.  
Loved it in the park, hated it everywhere else. Too heavy, too linear.  
I wanted support, progressiveness, and that firm-mode lever!

That led straight to a **Fox Float X**.  
Stock tune, no spacers touched. Lighter than the coil or the Float X2, and the feel is right in the middle — active, but never wallowy.  
That lever lets me flip into a firmer platform on long, loose climbs. Perfect.

Next came the fork.  
The **Fox 38** was way too much for Reveille Peak, so I went with a **Fox Factory 36 GRIPX @ 160 mm**.  
Ten millimeters shorter doesn’t sound like much, but it changes everything.  
So I pulled up the geometry charts.

### Geometry by Feel and Math

A shorter fork steepens the head angle, shortens the wheelbase, and drops the bottom bracket.  
Would it ruin the SB150’s character?  

I lined it up against the SB140 and SB120 numbers and felt better right away.

| Model | Fork | Head Angle | BB Height | Wheelbase (LG) | Notes |
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--|
| **SB150 (stock 170 mm)** | 170 mm | 64.5° | 344 mm | 1223 mm | Baseline |
| **SB150BR (160 mm)** | 160 mm | ≈ 64.9° | ≈ 341 mm | ≈ 1218 mm | My setup |
| **SB140** | 160 mm | 65.4° | 341 mm | 1214 mm | Trail reference |
| **SB120** | 130 mm | 66.5° | 335 mm | 1205 mm | XC reference |

A few tenths steeper, a few millimeters lower, and just a touch shorter.  
Right between a 150’s stability and a 140’s agility.  
Basically, a free geometry update through subtraction.

### Step Two — Tires and Weight

The park rubber had to go.  
I swapped to a **Maxxis Rekon 2.4 front** and **Rekon Race 2.35 rear**, running **22 / 24 psi**.  
Fast, light, predictable — not perfect in moon-dust, but it rolls like a rocket.  
I kept the rims, drivetrain, and bars the same; just lighter where it mattered.

Even the pedals got the treatment: an old pair of m540's from the parts bin, cleaned, greased, and spun until they felt new again. No sense in buying something shiny when the old ones still work.

### Step Three — Fit and the Nerve-Wracking Cut

The old setup was pure enduro — tall front, slaaaaack.
For Rattler, I needed to drop the stack and get more weight on the front wheel.  

So I grabbed the hacksaw.  
Measured, 3 times.
Headset bearings from 2019 — still smooth, just needed fresh grease.  
With a couple of 3d printed spacers we were good, stack height landed perfect.

### Suspension Setup  
*(All clicks counted from fully closed / clockwise)*  

**Fork – Fox 36 Factory GRIP X (160 mm, 29")**  
- Air pressure: 95 psi  
- Sag: ≈ 30 %  
- High-speed compression (HSC): 8 clicks out (of 12)  
- Low-speed compression (LSC): 10 clicks out (of 16)  
- Rebound: 10 clicks out (of 16)  

**Shock – Fox Float X (stock)**  
- Sag: ≈ 28 %  
- Rebound: 10 clicks out (of 16)  
- Low-speed compression (LSC): 8 clicks out (of 11, in Open mode)  
- Firm lever: used for long, loose climbs as needed

The two play well together.  
Switch Infinity stays high, pedals clean, and that little blue lever on the Float X gives just enough firmness for the punchy death climbs.

### Maiden Voyage — The Breakfast Ride

The first ride was a pre-lap of the Rattler course.  
The bike worked better than I did.  

Rear suspension felt progressive and supportive on climbs, smooth when things got ugly.  
Might add a volume spacer later, but it’s close.  
The 36 handled everything — no bob, perfect support.  
Only change I’ll make is sliding the saddle forward about half an inch.

No drama.  
No loose bolts.  
No weird noises.  
The bike just ripped.  
At roughly **30 pounds**, it feels like a trail bike that still remembers how to party.

The SB150 didn’t need saving.  
It just needed some attention and a few smart changes to match how the Rattler profile. Lighter fork, lighter shock, a geometry tweak that landed where I hoped, and a few parts I 3d printed.  
It’s the same bike I’ve always loved — just stripped back, tuned up, and ready for another chapter.  
Breakfast Ride because Yeti over-forks their bikes for lunch rides.  
I went the other way.
