I am not sure why, but I felt compelled to pull my 2010 Kona Unit from the attic and give it some love. So far, new alloy Race Face Turbine bars, the stem from my SB150, new Bronze SRAM disc brakes, and a bit of cleaning. Next up tires and figuring out gear inches for something I might possibly be able to push on these hills.
