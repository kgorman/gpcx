TR1 is a compact tool roll holder designed for mountain bike and gravel bike riders to carry essential trail-side repair tools.

I've been testing this idea for almost 6 months now, it's been on my bike every ride since about October. All the races, rides, crashes, whatever, I've improved it enough I am ready for a couple of folks to tell me what they think. That's what this beta is for.

## Design Principles

- **Lightweight** - Because weight matters
- **Strong** - Holds your jank solid. You never worry
- **Useful** - When shit breaks, you pull your roll, fix it, and on with your day or race
- **Doesn't look like ass** - Form follows function, but it should still look good

## What It's Not

- It's not some uber-weight-weenie shave your legs thing. If you want to stash micro tools all over your bike like it's an easter egg hunt, cool, but this isn't your answer.
- If you carry all your shit in your USWE pack or jersey, I get it, cool, again, not for you.

## Construction

The tool roll holder is made from carbon fiber infused polymer and pure carbon rails. These materials are super durable, light, and last forever with exposure to moisture, UV, etc. Plus they are right at home with your fancy carbon frame.

## What I'm Sending

- **A tool roll holder** - Goes on your water bottle bosses. It screws on, I provided the hardware, it's easy to mount. One sip of beer level job. But crush the beer anyway.
- **A tool roll** (if you want) - I have a couple of Toolsie rolls from San Util Designs (my fav). If you have something else, let me know, I want to hear how it works.

## What I Want (Please)

I'm interested in hearing your feedback. Critical feedback, you can't hurt my feelings, I gotta hear the good, bad and ugly. Text me.
