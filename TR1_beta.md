TR1 is a compact tool roll holder designed for mountain bike and gravel bike riders to carry essential trail-side repair tools.

## Design Principles

- **Lightweight** - Because weight matters
- **Strong** - Holds your jank solid. You never worry
- **Useful** - When shit breaks, you pull your roll, fix it, and on with your day or race
- **Doesn't look like ass** - Form follows function, but it should still look good

## What It's Not

- It's not some uber-weight-weenie shave your legs thing. If you want to stash micro tools all over your bike like it's an easter egg hunt, cool, but this isn't your answer.
- If you carry all your shit in your USWE pack or jersey, I get it, cool, again, not for you.

## What I'm Sending

- **A tool roll holder** - Goes on your water bottle bosses. It screws on, I provided the hardware, it's easy to mount. One sip of beer level job. But crush the beer anyway.
- **A tool roll** (if you want) - I have a couple of Toolsie rolls from San Util Designs (my fav). If you have something else, let me know, I want to hear how it works.

## What I Want (Please)

I'm interested in hearing your feedback. Critical feedback, you can't hurt my feelings, I gotta hear the good, bad and ugly. Text me.
