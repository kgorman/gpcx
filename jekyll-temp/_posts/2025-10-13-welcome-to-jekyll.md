# Hello Jekyll!

This is your first blog post with Jekyll. You can write content using Markdown syntax, which is much simpler than dealing with a complex CMS.

## Code Example

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, Jekyll!")
```

## Adding Images

You can add images like this:

## Links

[Check out Jekyll's documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)

Jekyll is a fantastic static site generator that takes Markdown files and converts them into a complete website. No database required!
