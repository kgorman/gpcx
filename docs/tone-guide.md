# GPCX.cc — Tone & Voice Guide

## Core Identity
GPCX.cc is a handmade digital zine about **rides, parts, and the garage in between.**
It's written by someone who actually rides, breaks stuff, fixes it, and rides again.
It's **not** a brand, not content marketing, and not optimized for clicks.
It's the dirt-under-the-fingernails version of storytelling.

### Tagline
> ride stories & garage experiments

## Voice Principles

- **Honest.** Say what happened, not what should've happened.
- **Low-key confident.** You've been doing this for decades; you don't need hype.
- **Conversational but edited.** Sounds like talking to a friend over a beer after a ride.
- **Self-aware.** A little humor, a little humility.
- **Grimy-handshake tone.** Think *Bike Mag* in the 90s — dust, sweat, and long sentences that somehow land softly.
- **Lowercase bias.** Avoid title case. Avoid corporate words. Use contractions and pauses.

## Style Rules

### Structure
- Start with a hook or visual (a ride, a tool, a moment).
- Tell it in a few tight paragraphs.
- End with a reflection, laugh, or quick sign-off.
- Each piece should feel like a snapshot, not a press release.

### Words to Use
ride, trail, bench, garage, dust, torque, bolt, print, tune, break, fix, test, coffee, beer, hill, texas, front range, colorado, downieville.

### Words to Avoid
optimize, community engagement, influencer, synergy, lifestyle, performance metrics.

### Punctuation & Formatting
- lowercase headlines.
- em-dashes and ellipses are fine; they match the rhythm.
- keep sentences short; break long ones with rhythm.
- use italics for thoughts or emphasis; no bold shouting.

## Newsletter Tone
The newsletter is **a new issue of the zine**, not an announcement.

**Each email should feel like:**
> "here's what happened this week — a few rides, a few ideas, a couple of things from the bench."

Use 2–3 short blurbs, each 3–5 sentences max, separated by dashed lines or `<hr>`.

### Opening Examples
- rides, parts, and the garage in between — here's what's new this week.  
- some dust, a few photos, and one idea that worked (mostly).  
- a couple of fresh stories from the hill country.

### Sign-off Examples
- see you out there — kg  
- back soon with more dust and fewer bolts left over  
- until next ride — kenny

## Reference Style Summary
- **Voice:** authentic, mechanic-poet, dirt-real.  
- **Perspective:** first person, grounded in experience.  
- **Cadence:** slow burn, thoughtful, sometimes funny.  
- **Aesthetic:** 35mm film grit, handwritten notes, beer can next to torque wrench.  
- **Goal:** make readers feel like they're in the garage or waiting at the trailhead.

## Example Short Piece

> first taste of gravel  
> texas gravel racing is its own thing — part suffering, part barbecue.  
> i signed up to see what the fuss was about, and found out fast.  
> maybe that's the point.

**Use this tone for:**  
- Weekly "what's new" emails  
- Ride stories and bench notes  
- Captions, blurbs, intros, and summaries

If in doubt, imagine it as something printed, folded, and handed to a friend after a ride.
